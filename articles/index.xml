In Manusmriti chapter 9, there is discussion about what the texts call Mahapatakas- great crimes that brings upon great Paapam (karmic demerit) to the performer and causes injury to society. These include murder, stealing, adultery, etc. In this context Manu says that the perpetrators if they refuse to perform expiation, they must be banished after confiscating all their property. In this context, the text adds following verses:
King shall not appropriate property of man guilty of heinous crime; if, through greed he takes it, he becomes tainted with that guilt—9.</description>

nambUtiri-paternal-uncle-shrAddha In Shankarasmriti, the code of law which became popular in Kerala with rise of Namboothiri tradition, It is stated that the eldest son in a family must perform Pitr Karma for all his paternal uncles as well.
It is since younger brothers of father mostly married into matrilineal castes like Kshatriya-Nairs and Ambalavasis, and they did not have any heir to perform Pitra Karma for them becuase children in these unions belonged to mother&amp;rsquo;s family and they performed Pitr Karma to their maternal uncles or karnavars instead of their fathers.</description>
