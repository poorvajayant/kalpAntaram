Arya tradition places importance on the right coupling of teacher and student &amp;ndash; not every student is right for every teacher &amp;amp; vice versa. This is a custom-made pair. For exoteric matters, this might not matter that much &amp;ndash; as long as there is sufficient compatibilty &amp;amp; competence on both sides, one can learn procedures from the teacher.
However, behind the procedures is a &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; that might be termed &amp;ldquo;esoteric&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Data We may infer from shaiva exegetical texts that the whole of the shaiva-shAstra was held as authoritative at a general level: starting from the old pAshupata material down to the latest srotAMsi and their evolutes. We know that abhinavagupta and Bhatta rAmakaNTha-II were approximately coeval and abhinavagupta quotes rk quite positively providing evidence that the totality of the general validity shaiva-shAstra was held by a leading kaula teacher of the time.</description>
