      <description>What does Gurukula mean:
Kula is already referring to a lineage. While all lineages have their own validity, not all lineages are the same. It is an academic institution where you learn real Shastras but this real learning is not separated from sādhanā. Vimarsha as it stands now is both a movement and a school. My old approach to just a school did not work. Why? That means I have to rely on resourceful people and at the end, the agenda gets derailed and everything in the world is sucked up into the belly of the monster called politics.</description>
