      <description>Introduction: Teaser: What is up with your hair? What is that mark on your forehead? And what is with this sanskrit mumbo jumbo? Can&amp;rsquo;t you be like everyone else?
Clicking on the above picture will take you to Rabbi Shergil&amp;rsquo;s rendition of &amp;ldquo;pagri sambhAl jaTTa&amp;rdquo;.
Being different? In what way? One may value identifying oneself closely with the 5k + year old hindu stream of thought.
As part of one&amp;rsquo;s culturally distinct way of being/ path of self cultivation, one may express myself in Sanskrit verses, don a shikhA, wear the sacred thread (yajnopavitam), mark my body in several places with hindu symbols, do rituals, speak incantations in private and public etc.</description>

      <description>Allowence for tradition-specific exclusive ritual spaces and beliefs &amp;ldquo;As it is in a diverse, polytheist society, every group of Hindus, has a general right to create its own traditions and develop an exclusive ritual space for its own needs. The rural traditions centred around their local, village pantheons as well as the tribal systems had their own separate, sacred spaces. Even then, brāhmaṇa-s, who overwhelmingly were responsible for developing the śrauta, gṛhya, paurāṇika and āgamika ritual content, were interested in expanding access for their non- brāhmaṇa brethren.</description>
