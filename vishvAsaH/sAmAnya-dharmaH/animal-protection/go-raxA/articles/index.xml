      <description>Source: Nikhil
bulls and kine (mainly the latter) are often called ághnya/ā &amp;ldquo;not to be slain&amp;rdquo; in the Véda, despite the same texts referring to the killing of kine. There are two ways by which scholars reconcile this:
It was not permitted to kill them while still fertile/productive (capable of producing offspring or of producing milk for their calves and for men), and ághnyā refers specifically to the productive cow rather than the vaşā́ (barren cow).</description>

      <description>Personal Preference for deshI-s curious if you could list your reasons for preferring deshi cows ( our steppe ancestors likely shifted to it after invasion)
My reasons are not science based , only experience (might even be confirmation bias, I can’t say) and practicality.
Milk quality Also, while the quantity of milk is lesser, the density is higher, you get more ghee from same amount of desi cow milk, if fed well on grains - I’ve seen myself, like our cows do - their milk being dense at par with buffaloes.</description>
