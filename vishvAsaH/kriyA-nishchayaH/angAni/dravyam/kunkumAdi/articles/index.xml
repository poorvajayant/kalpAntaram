      <description>(For other techniques, see here.)
If one is interested to prepare Srichurnam on his own, here is the method to prepare it. This method of preparing Srichurnam has been carried forward for generations:
Take few pieces of Gundu Manjal/ Turmeric (Not Kasturi Manjal), as shown in the picture above. In this case, lets take 8 pieces of Gundu Manjal One small tumbler(azhaaku) of rice. (8:1 Ratio – Manjal:Rice) Soak both the Manjal and Rice in water for 8 hours After 8 hours, filter out water completely Start crushing it coarsely by using stone (idi kal) or by Mixie.</description>

      <description>Source: Vijay B (a familiar friend), 2016. Location: Santa Clara CA and India.
My son had lead poisoning from yellow-srichUrNam that was store bought (sent from India).
Discovery He was chewing on paint chips on a visit to India. So when we went back I got a preventive lead test done. Came positive. We thought it was the paint. They did a second test in 2-3 weeks and while the number went down, it didn&amp;rsquo;t go down as much as expected.</description>

      <description>The Hazards of Synthetic Sindoor
October 1, 2004
BY TIRTHO BANERJEE
The recent New Jersey case in which a couple and their 13-year-old child were diagnosed with serious lead poisoning due to regular consumption of sindoor as a food coloring has come as a shock. Sindoor was never meant for use in any type of eatable. Sindoor or kumkum as it is known in the South, is meant for use as a forehead mark, referred to as tilak, bindi or pottu, put on the spot between the brows which is considered the seat of latent wisdom, the ajna chakra.</description>
