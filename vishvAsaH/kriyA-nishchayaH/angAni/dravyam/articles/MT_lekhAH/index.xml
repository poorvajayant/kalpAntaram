varAhamihira was a Hindu encyclopedist who lived in the 500s of the CE era. He may have descended from a family of shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas, as suggested by the mihira epithet in his name combined with varAha. This is also suggested by his tendencies for solar-system worship which appears to have been a trait of the shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas or Iranian Hindu brahmins. He covers an extraordinary range of topics in his encyclopedic works ranging from astronomy, mathematics, rituals, yavana jAtaka-s, augury, sooth-saying of various kinds, and worship of Hindu gods through idols.</description>
