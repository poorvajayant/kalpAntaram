      <description>01 Importance of cāturmāsya
Though the name cāturmāsya is familiar to many of us in the row of vratas, there is an impression that it is related to monks and some Maḍi hengasaru (some women in the olden days who were very orthodox) and people belonging to the other Āśramas need not consider it. This is a result of misunderstanding. From the view point of śāstras this is a parva that should be observed by everyone.</description>

      <description>A few objections pertaining to the observance of this vrata and answers to them. avaidikatā (a) The name of this yajna called cāturmāsya appears both in Vedas and smṛtis. But it is not the famous cāturmāsya mentioned in the purāṇas that is being currently practiced. When we study the vedaśāstras, we find that there are some season-related vidhis, which have to be observed on the full moon days of the months of caitra, phālguṇa, Āshāḍha and kārtika.</description>

      <description>05 The modalities of the vrata
Those who observe the vrata should go on fast, worship Śrī Nārāyaṇa and pray him “O Lord! I am observing this vrata in your Sānnidhya. This can be completed without hurdles, only with your blessings. In case my life departs from the body in the middle of this vrata, let me obtain the fruits, of the vrata then also with your blessings.” And, reducing the worldly activities as much as possible, one should worship Lord Nārāyaṇa who is delightful in the posture of sleep, with meditation, stotra and worship etc.</description>
