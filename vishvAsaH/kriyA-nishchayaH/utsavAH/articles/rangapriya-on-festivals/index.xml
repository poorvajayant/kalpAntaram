      <description>उपशमितमेघनादम्
प्रज्वलितदशाननम् रमितरामम् ।
रामायणमिव सुभगम्
दीपदिनं हरतु वो दुरितम्॥
Just as Meghanāda (Indrajit) who becomes quieted in the Rāmāyaṇa, the meghanāda becomes silent in this great festival. Like the ten faced Rāvaṇa who is burnt in Rāmāyaṇa, the tips of the wicks are lighted in this festival. As Rāma rejoiced in Rāmāyaṇa, Śrī Rāma and beautiful women enjoy here. This way let the day of Dīpāvaḷi mahotsava which is delightful like Rāmāyaṇa, ward off our your sins.</description>

      <description>Gaṇeśa caturthī is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in India. This is a festival that comes generally a day after Gaurī festival or sometimes comes on the same day of Gaurī festival itself. Even those who do not celebrate Gaurī festival, celebrate this festival without fail. Gaṇeśa is the most popular deity. The proverb ‘Gaṇapanillada Grāmavilla’ (There is no village without Gaṇapa) is well known. Before elaborating upon the festival, we shall discuss about Gaṇeśa, the presiding deity of the festival.</description>

      <description>Gaurī Festival is one of the most important parvas that comes in the month of Bhādrapada. Though it is generally known as ‘Gaurī Habba’, the śāstraic name happens to be ‘SvarṇaGaurīvrata’. This is because this festival is unique and has distinct features compared to other vratas pertaining to Gaurī such as ‘Saubhāgyagaurī’, ‘Sampadgaurī’, ‘maṅgalagaurī’, ‘Lāvaṇyagaurī’, ‘Trilocanagaurī’, ‘Gajagaurī’ etc. Though all these are Gaurī festivals, ‘SvarṇaGaurīvrata’ is the most famous of these, and the practice of calling only this as ‘Gaurī festival’ is in vogue.</description>

      <description>Hanumajjayantī is an important festival celebrated in the month of Caitra, after ŚrīRāmanavami. The deity worshipped on that day is Hanumān. He is a mahātma, famously known by names such as Āñjaneya, Māruti, Prāṇadevaru, Tiruvadi, Mahāvīra etc, in the literature of jnānis and devotees. It is but natural that, after the worship of Śrī Rāma on Rāmanavami and on a day very close to Śrī Rāmanavami, the custom of worshipping this God who is the greatest among the retinue of ŚrīRāma, who is dear to devotees, dear to scholars and who is very popular, continues even to this day.</description>

      <description>11 Kṛttikā dīpotsava (Śivadīpa Viśṇudīpa ṃahotsavas)
1. Names of the parvas We see many Dīpotsava parvas in the line of festivals of Bhāratīyas where rows of lamps are lighted in temples, homes, maṭhas, Āśramas and Mandirs, both inside and outside those places. The most famous parvas among these are the Vishṇu dīpa and Śiva dīpa (Mahotsavas).
These two fall either on the same day or one of them comes on the next day of the other, and thus they declare the deep relationship of Śiva and Vishṇu, to the sentimental devotees.</description>

      <description>Mahāśivarātri is one of the most important parvas among the festivals of Bhāratīyas. Just as Prayāga and Pushkara are called ‘Tīrtharāja’, Mahāśivarātri is called ‘vratarāja’. This vrata is observed in all parts of Bhāratadeśa with concern reverence and devotion.
Though this is a festival where the prominent deity is Śiva and a very special parva for śaivites, even Vaishṇavas and worshippers of other great devatās also should specially worship God (Śiva) on Śivarātri.</description>

      <description>It is necessary to take note of another important observence regarding the study of Vedas. It is called ‘Adhyāyotsarjana’ or shortly utsarjana’.
What is this Utsarjana? Utsarjana or Udvāsana means leaving off or sending off. Leaving off what? It is the (leaving off of) vedic studies. On the day of Upākarma, after the worship of sages and deities, Vedas have to be begun (again) as per precepts, and having studied thus for a period of time constantly, the studies should be suspended temporarily, and the duration of studies also has to be limited.</description>

      <description>The importance of Kārtikamāsa The most famous festival in the month of Kārtika is Utthānadvādaśī.
As is evident from the lines
“कार्तिके ज्ञानसिद्धिः स्यात्” कार्तिके तु कृता दीक्षा नृणां जन्मविमोचिनी”
the entire month of Kārtika is conducive to jnānasiddhi and mantradīkshā svīkāra. And, as evident from
“ज्ञानं महेश्वरादिच्छेत्”, all the Mondays of this month are very dear to Lord Śiva who is renowned as the deity who bestows jnāna. Kārtika śukla navamī is the day stipulated to perform Vishṇutrirātra vrata.</description>

      <description>Varamahālakshmīvrata is considered as one of the most famous vratas observed in the month of śrāvaṇa. In case the month of śrāvaṇa occurs twice in the form of nija and adhika (regular and intercalary), this Vrata is observed only in the nija śrāvaṇa. Even though it is not enjoined among the regular vratas like Ekādaśī, Śivarātri etc which should be observed by all, this vrata is observed to please Goddess Jaganmātā with great devotion and religious fervour by a large number of devotees in our country.</description>
