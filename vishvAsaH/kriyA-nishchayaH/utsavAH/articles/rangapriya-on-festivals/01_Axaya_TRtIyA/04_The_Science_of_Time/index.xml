      <description>A) Māsa: In the celebration of this festival, barley is prescribed as the main substance for Havana, pūja and dāna. Gifting wheat, Bengalgram and roasted barley powder are also mentioned as the most suitable ones for dāna. In our country which is predominantly agricultural, it is only in the month of vaiśākha all these (grains) become readily available, both for consumption and for sacrificial and religious purposes. Thus the science in (mentioning) Vaiśākha as the month may be noticed, when all the specific materials required for the ritual of the parva are available in plenty.</description>

      <description>b) Tithi: The tithi of this parva, viz. tṛtīyā is called ‘Jayātithi’. And that too, the Jayātithi of Śukla Paksha is very auspicious.
नन्दा भद्रा जया रिक्ता पूर्णाःस्युः तिथयः पुनः ।
पर्यायत्वेन विज्ञेयाः ॥(पीयूषधारा = नारद वचन)
“उदकुम्भान् सकनकान् सान्नान् सर्वरसैः सह ।
“यवगोधूमचणकान् सक्तु दध्योदनं तथा ॥(निर्णय सिन्धु)
The name Jayā indicates that it is the precious time for success, ie the securing of the accomplishment of the endeavours taken up with auspicious intentions.</description>

      <description>C. Vāra and Nakshatra. Yogis says that if on that day, there is a conjunction of Rohiṇī with either Monday or Wednesday, it is a (rare) Yoga which is a result of imperishable good deeds. This is because, those two days and Rohiṇī are very auspicious days for the worship of Lord Kṛshṇa. So, on Akshaya Tṛtīyā, it is only ŚrīKṛshṇa who is to be specially worshipped after the worship of the ishṭadevatā isn’t it?</description>

      <description>04 Application to the festival
Śāstras have prescribed the third day of the Śuklapaksha of Vaiśākha which happens to be the latter half of the spring season for this festival. It should be noted that all the limbs of the above said time, happen to be highly favourable for the observance of this festival.
The distinction of Vasanta renowned as the king of seasons, has been explained in the discussion on Ugādi.</description>
