Indo-European expansions and iconography: revisiting the anthropomorphic stelae
Was there an early Indo-European iconography? The anthropomorphic stelae There is no linguistic evidence for the presence of iconic or temple worship among the early Indo-Europeans. However, after their migrations, when they settled in the lands of sedentary peoples, they adopted a range of religious icons often stylistically influenced by local traditions. Nevertheless, there are some clear iconographic features of their deities and other divine entities that shine through these local styles (to be discussed in later notes).</description>

It is nearly inconceivable for the average modern Hindu to imagine his religion as being aniconic. Worship at temples is an average Hindu’s major or only of religious activity, and it is not uncommon for practically every Hindu to keep some household images or pictures of deities. Yet, there is hardly any sign of temples or worship in temples in the vedic saMhitA-s, which are dominated by fire and soma rituals.</description>

Late in the evening the my clansmen and me left by an uncomfortable bus journey through the drAviDa country to the outpost of aunts N and H. Their clansmen had been killed by fiery abhichAras of their shatrus, but they took the help of our learned co-ethnic, a master of the mantra-shAstra to save themselves. While in gavalakuNDa he was a student of the descendent of that great exponent of samaya-vidyA of the east.</description>

Both the avaykta and the nR^isiMha-tApini explain that the yantra with the ugra viShNu formula should be tied as an amulet. The nR^isiMha-tApini explains the structure of the great yantra of viShNu that simultaneously encompasses :1) the bIja of nR^isiMha and the praNava. 2) the sudarshana chakra mUla mantra. 3) the nArAyaNa aShTAkSharI 4) the vAsudeva dvAdashAkSharI 5) the ShoDasha mAtR^ika bIja-s 6) the ugra viShNu formula.The formal worship of the yantra and viShNu embodied in it may be done thus.</description>
