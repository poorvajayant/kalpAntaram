      <description>Vidiśā in the Days of Gupta Hegemony
Prologue
In his monumental Geschichte Indiens Hermann Kulke depicts the relationship between the Gupta and Vākāṭaka dynasties as basically an unproblematic
one, an alliance that was dominated by the Guptas and secured a peaceful coexistence till their fall.
Vermutlich in der Phase der Vorbereitung seines Krieges gegen die Kshatrapa gab dann aber Candragupta seine Tochter dem König Rudrasena II. zur Ehe, um den Rücken für seinen Kampf im Westen frei zu habeṇ Rudrasena starb jedoch schon nach fünfjähriger Regierung etwa im Jahre 390 ṇ Chr̥ Auf Candraguptas Rat hin übernahm daraufhin seine Tochter Prabhavatigupta die Regentschaft für ihre Söhne.</description>

      <description>The Formative Period of Gupta–Vākāṭaka Culture
Udayagiri
When, at the beginning of the 5th century, the royal elephant carrying his majesty climbed the slopes of the Udayagiri for a visit to the sacred complex, Emperor Candragupta made sure not to give offence to any of the parties involved in his grand projecṭ His aim was clearly defined in the inscription that records his visit, namely the winning of the entire earth: He (Vīrasena) has come here in the company of the king himself, who was on his way of winning the entire earth, and he has commissioned this cave out of devotion for Lord Śambhu.</description>

      <description>Transgression and Atonement on a Hill in the South
and the Inadequacy of Substitutes
Preamble
Coming from a part of the world where there are neither holy places nor mountains, it may seem strange that my professional career has been marked by the research of these two phenomena. Curiosity to discover unknown fields, no doubt, lies at the base of every scholarly endeavour, but in my case there may have been a more compelling factor, namely the fascination for the cultural and religious world of India.</description>

Trivikrama: Word and Statue
Preamble
A long series of seminars at the Institute of Indian Studies of the University of Groningen came to its preliminary conclusion in 1993. In these seminars, in which Rob Adriaensen, Harunaga Isaacson and Hans Bakker took part, the newly discovered stone inscription in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple (KNT) on
top of the Rāmagiri (Ramtek Hill) had been studied; this study resulted in the publication of the inscription with a translation and commentary (Bakker &amp;amp; Isaacson 1993; above, pp.</description>

      <description>Commemorating the Dead
Ajay Mitra Shastri
One of the dear memories I have of Prof Dr Ajay Mitra Shastri is the moment that the doors of the arrival hall of Amsterdam Airport opened and I saw my learned friend leaving the ‘nothing to declare’ behind him. He came as a an invited speaker of the biennial conference of the European Association of South Asian Archæologists, held in Leiden in the summer of 1999.</description>

      <description>Preamble
Few scholars can claim mastery of such a wide range of different fields within the discipline of Indology as Prof Dr Oskar von Hinüber̥ One of the branches of learning that owes a great deal to his studies is Indian epigraphy. My contribution here is meant as a humble tribute to Oskar and his work.

      <description>The Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription of the Time of Udayasena Reconsidered
Introduction
The hill near the village Ramgarh, on whose top (height 184 m) the so-called
‘Muṇḍeśvarī Temple’ is found,1 belongs to the northern spurs of the Kaimur Range, the eastern embranchment of the Vindhyas. It is situated in the Kaimur District of southwest Bihar, 70 km SE of Vārāṇasī, 170 km SW of Patna, 60 km
NW of Rohtasgarh on the River Son, and 8 km SW of Bhabua, as the crow flies.</description>

      <description>Preamble
The scope of this study is limited to funerary practices within the brahminical (Hindu) fold of the ancient period, i.e. North India from the Vedic Age to the reign of King Harṣavardhana (7th century). Funerary practices in South India, Dravida country, and Southeast Asia seem to have differed significantly from those in North India. 1 They deserve a study of their owṇ In late medieval North India new forms of commemoration ( samādhis, chatarīs) emerged,</description>

      <description>The Image of Man in the Sacrificial Context
The image of man
To the Greek philosopher Xenophanes (6th century bc) the following insight is ascribed:
But if cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands and do the works that men can do, horses would draw the forms of the gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their bodies such as they each had themselves.</description>

      <description>The Case of Vārāṇasī
I do homage to Sarasvatī and Ga ˙
ngā,
both holy and enchanting streams;
the latter washes away the sin of him
who bathes therein and drinks of its waters;
the former destroys the ignorance
of him who speaks or hears of iṭ
(RCM 1 C15.1, tr̥ Hill)
Introduction
In the eulogizing stanzas that precede the Acts of Rāma, Tulsīdās makes a
curious remark:
[I do homage] to Hara, too, and Girijā, who for the good of the world and with regard to the evil of this age composed a number of spells in a barbarous tongue, incongruous syllables, meaningless mutterings, whose influence is manifest by the power of Maheśa.</description>

      <description>Preamble
Although, since Mahatma Gandhi, India is known by many as the country where the principle of ahiṁsā, ‘not killing’, has being invented and implemented, this ancient principle had originally little or nothing to do with how warfare was conducted and conceived in Hindu society. War was endemic in South Asia and seen as the right and duty of the Hindu king. This warfare, however, was regulated by some rules, which were humane in some respects.</description>
