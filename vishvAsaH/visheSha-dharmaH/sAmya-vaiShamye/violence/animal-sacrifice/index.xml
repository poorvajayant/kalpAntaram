      <description>Story of uparichara vasu falling from heaven for siding with the deities on animal sacrifice [Mbh 12.37, Mbh 14.91]. &amp;ldquo;Although animal sacrifices were prevalent in the Vedic period, there were already some attempts to reduce this. They came up with the idea that instead of killing an animal, one could offer heartfelt praise to the gods or a fuel-stick or cooked food (see RVS 8.19.5 and 8.24.20 for example). In later times, they even developed an ingenious theory that a person who eats meat will—in his next birth—become the meat eaten by that animal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.</description>

      <description>References to cow sacrifices in veda-s
&amp;ldquo;In the Rigveda Saṃhitā, we see that our ancients cooked the flesh of oxen and offered it to the gods, especially Indra (see RVS 10.86.14 or 10.27.2, for example). Horses, bulls, oxen, barren cows, and rams were sacrificed for Agni (RVS 10.91.14). Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.1.2.21 says that sage Yājñavalkya would eat the meat of cows and oxen, provided it was tender. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.18 says that if a couple wants to beget a son who will grow up to be a great scholar, they have to eat rice cooked with beef, along with ghee.</description>

      <description>pashuyAga-s kapinjala-adhikaraNa of mImAmsa-shAstra is a classic illustration (where the question of how many kapinjala birds are to be sacrificed is considered). Certain compulsory पशुयाग-s (usually goat sacrifices) are required of agnihotri-s Eg: निरूढपशुबन्धः. [Note: Optional cow and horse sacrifice exist, but are barred by the dharma-shAstra-s in the kali-yuga.] Recent examples - DH16. gavAlambha / cow sacrifice is also referred to in the manu-smRti, and others (eg: as part of madhuparka).</description>
