&amp;ldquo;He who has purified his soul by good deeds and controlled his senses; such a shUdra should be attended upon with respect like a dvija; thus is the dictate of brahma&amp;rdquo;
ब्राह्मण्यं देवि दुष्प्रापं
निसर्गाद् ब्राह्मणः शुभे ।
क्षत्रियो वैश्य-शूद्रौ वा
निसर्गाद् इति मे मतिः ॥६॥
brAhmaNyam (brAhmaNa-ness) is difficult to obtain; it comes innately; so does kSatriyatvam, etc.
त्रेताग्नि-मन्त्र-विहितो
वैश्यो भवति वै यदि ॥ स वैश्यः क्षत्रियकुले</description>

      <description>There is some deal of fluidity in varNa in contrast to jAti but brAhmaNa varNa was not fluid to same degree. Given the responsibility, it&amp;rsquo;s natural that the level scrutiny before one can be a brahman will be greater. It&amp;rsquo;s just about merit, or more? There is absolutely no escaping the hereditary component as far as &amp;ldquo;brAhmaNa&amp;rdquo; is concerned&amp;hellip;There is a finite number of gotras from which a brAhmaNa must have obtained patrilineal descent (svIkAra, adoption arrangements) between gotras were accepted.</description>

      <description>Source: Angirasa Shreshta
One of the most prevalent misconceptions extant in modern discourse is that the brāhmaṇa-s monopolized “religious resources” at the expense of others. Now, broadly speaking, we can identify two types of the aforementioned resources:
Knowledge: To what extent were jāti-s, belonging to varṇa-s apart from the brāhmaṇa, were able to access generic knowledge as well as knowledge specific to a particular sampradāya? Ritual: To what extent, Hindus, other than the brāhmaṇa-s, had access to ritual systems by way of dīkṣā (initiation)?</description>

      <title>shishu AngIrasa</title>

      <description>The misinterpretation Some quote:
“I am a reciter of hymns, my father is a healer, my mother a grinder of corn. We desire to obtain wealth through various actions”&amp;ndash; Rig Veda 9.112.3 Do they have the same Varna?
This is an incorrect pramANa. A simple glancing of svAmin sAyaNa’s bhASya and the context of the Rk would explain it. The draSTa is the child RSi - shishu A~Ngirasa as can be seen from the informal way he calls his parents tata and nanA.</description>
