Class, Caste, and Genes
An article by Sabrina Tavernise appeared in the New York Times a few days ago describing increasing perceptions of class conflict in America, and there is a lot of recent commentary in the press about this report from the Pew Charitable Trust that claims there is less class mobility here than in several other northern countries. It is not very clear to me what the complaints really are or what alternatives exist.</description>

This is from a 3yr old video. He has said such content as recently as two days ago. So I am not making it up and all this is public content. It is the traditional stance on Equality as well. Vouched by many other Acharyas. Approximate Translation of Jeeyar&amp;rsquo;s talk follows:
People keep getting into fights with each other in the name of politics, in the name of caste or in many cases in the name of religion.</description>

      <description>In Bṛhaspatismṛti, the king is told to protect the dharmas of those born of pratilomas, those residing in forts, and the dharmas of specific deśa &amp;amp; jāti. Even though, elsewhere they may be punishable, but for them they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so, or else they would develop aversion for the king, which&amp;rsquo;ll lead to destruction of his power and treasury. Following are some examples of dharmas given:
Dākṣiṇātya dvijas marry the sibling of their mothers, etc.</description>

      <description>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्) If a Brahmin fail to observe his or her duties, the kings of Kochi had power to take away all the privilege and banish them from the caste.
Land of Perumals by Francis Day. It&amp;rsquo;s from 19th century.
A Brahman should not trade, join in popular conversation, music, dancing, or any thing else inconsistent with a grave deportment: he ought to shun temporal honours, to perform three great actions, read their sacred books, have a son, and offer regular sacrifices: after which, he may in due time, make over his duties to his son.</description>

      <description>Source: TW conversation between AryAMsha and MT
Hostis Xenos The Latin &amp;lsquo;hostis&amp;rsquo; (hostile) &amp;amp; the Greek &amp;lsquo;xenos&amp;rsquo; (xenophobic) did not always have a -ve sense. They originally used to mean &amp;lsquo;guest&amp;rsquo;, someone in a reciprocal relationship with your clan. As the Greco-Romans lost their clannish society, &amp;ldquo;guests&amp;rdquo; became &amp;ldquo;enemies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;strangers&amp;rdquo;. As their clans grew, cities came up, the polis replaced the basic interactional unit of one dempotis / paterfamilias with another, as they became nations from tribes; the clan-clan reciprocality ended.</description>

      <description>अब्राह्मणेषु सर्वेषु
सर्वस्मिन् ब्राह्मण-ब्रुवे ।
नाम-धारक-मात्रेषु
श्रोत्रियेषु महत्स्व् अपि॥१२॥
सर्वेष्व् अपि च वेदैक-
पारगेषु महात्मसु।
ब्रह्मत्वम् एक-सामान्यात्
तिष्ठत्य् एव ह्यनश्वरम् ॥ १३ ॥
तन्-महत्-तारतम्येन
न्यूनं चाऽधिकम् एव च।
महच् च सुमहच् चापि
दोष-युक्तं गुणोत्तरम्॥१४॥
निर्दोषम् इति भेदेन
बहुधाभि(हि)मृतेति तत्(स्मृतं) ।
सर्व-कर्मैक-शून्ये ऽस्मिन्
कलौ पापैकसङ्कुले॥१५॥
कर्मानुरूपं ब्रह्मत्वं
प्रतिष्ठति हि भूतले । तन्न दूष्यं दुराधर्षं
युगधर्मानुरूपकम्॥ १६
कपिलस्मृतिः
In all (six kinds of) Abrāhmaṇas (lowly Brāhmaṇas), in Brāhmaṇabruva (one who merely says, &amp;ldquo;I am Brāhmaṇa&amp;rdquo;, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform actions of a Brāhmaṇa), in those who merely possess the name (Brāhmaṇa), in the great Śrotriyas, and in the noble experts of Vedas, the indestructible Brahmatva (Brāhmaṇatva) stays as being one thing which is common.</description>
