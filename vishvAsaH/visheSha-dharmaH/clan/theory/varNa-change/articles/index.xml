Came across very interesting details about the royal Hiranyagarbha ceremony performed by Travancore Maharajas from the records of Sri Padmanabha Swamy temple. The ritual includes the king entering a large golden jar which had filled with panchagavya (5 cow products) and coming out of it after Brahmins chanting Veda Mantras. Originally, the ritual included construction of large image of Golden Cow , which was later replaced by a Golden Jar.</description>

      <description>Author: Satyan on TW.
The &amp;lsquo;varṇa by birth&amp;rsquo; system sounds linear and easily comprehensible only if one does not consider thousands of years of mixed varṇa marriages, the offspring as a result of them, and the change of varṇa by following the āpaddharma even in the absence of āpat.
Heritage detection The mentions of the offspring who were not publicly known as being born of such a marriage, is found in Manusmṛti 10.</description>

      <description>Initiation and dvijatA यथा हेमादिधातूनां
पाके क्रमवशाद्भवेत् ।।५१२।।
रजतादि तथा संवित्-
संस्कारे द्विजतान्तरे ।
As gold and other metals happen to assume the hue other than their own on being heated in fire, such as those of silver, etc., even so having been subjected to the process of sanctification, the student attains the status of the twice-born leaving his earlier status behind. (512b-513a)
योनिर् न कारणं तत्र
शान्तात्मा द्विज उच्यते ॥५१३।।</description>

महादानानि From Laugākṣismṛti :
By performing Mahādāna, Śūdra becomes eligible for Vedaśravaṇa. By performing all Dānas like Tulādāna, he becomes eligible for performing rituals with Vedamantras. By peforming Mahādānas thrice, he becomes equal to Vipra. By performing the Brahmāṇḍakaṭāha Mahādāna seven times, Śūdra becomes non-Śūdra. By performing Gosahasradāna thrice he becomes equal similar to Vipra. उच्चारणे तादृशस्य वेदवर्णस्य सन्ततम् ।
उप/&amp;hellip; कारः ब्राह्मणस्य महात्मनः ॥
स्नातस्य कृतकार्यस्य
शुचेरेव विशेषतः ।</description>
