It is fashionable these days for some parents to describe their daughters by the following terms:
Modern 2) Forward 3) City-type 4) Progressive 5) Modern but Indian. Modern but Spiritual. The simple message is that one must be beware of such women- they are verily living graveyards for the deluded. The Hindu youth have been deluded in many ways by the waves of mlecchaic subversion lashing the Indian shores.</description>

While there are reams of writings on the yeses and nos of Hindu marriage there is a short sanskrit tract called the agni-vivAha smR^iti that provides its somewhat atypical account of the same. The text is attributed to a certain puShkara and contains 19 verses. The tract may be dated to approximately to the period of the first 6 centuries of the common era. I examined it because it throws interesting light on old Indian customs.</description>
