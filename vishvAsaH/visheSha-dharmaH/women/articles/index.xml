Indian Hindu women are still better than most women in world.
Reality is India is a society caught half way between modernity and the old world right now. As of today, a huge percentage of socially conservative young women exist. 20 years ago most if not all Indian women were socially conservative. Now a large percent are not and don&amp;rsquo;t give a ****, in Gen Z.
My question is - why dont you focus on getting one of the good women and then who cares about the rest of society?</description>
