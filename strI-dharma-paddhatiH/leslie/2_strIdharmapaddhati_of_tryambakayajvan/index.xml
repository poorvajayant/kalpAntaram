      <description>I. Tryambaka&amp;rsquo;s Introduction
(Sdhp. 1v. 1-2v. 5)
Tryambaka opens his treatise with a typical invocation: &amp;lsquo;Hail to Gaṇādhipati! Hail to Sarasvati! Hail to (the line) of teachers!&amp;rsquo;1 Gaṇādhipati, more commonly called Ganapati or Gaṇeśa (&amp;lsquo;Lord of troops&amp;rsquo;), is traditionally worshipped as the remover of obstacles. As &amp;lsquo;one who causes an auspicious beginning&amp;rsquo; (mangalārambhaḥ), he is invoked at the start of rituals or other projects. This is however a late development: Gaṇeśa is not invoked in the gṛhyaor dharmasutras.</description>

      <description>III. The Inherent Nature of Women
(strīsvabhāvaḥ; Sdhp.21r.3-22r.8)1
After instructing the virtuous wife on her duties throughout the day, Tryambaka turns to face the objection most likely to undermine his whole project. The problem is simple but devastating. If women are inherently wicked, as they are traditionally supposed to be, then how can they possibly have any interest in learning what Tryambaka is at such pains to teach them? Why does he bother to teach women at all?</description>

      <description>IV. The Duties Common to (all) Women (strīṇām sādhāraṇā dharmāḥ; Sdhp.22r.8-48v.6)
I shall present the remainder of Tryambaka&amp;rsquo;s lengthy treatise in the form of a summary. This fourth section is divided into nine major topics, following Tryambaka&amp;rsquo;s own rather loose subdivisions.
General rulings on behaviour (Sdhp.22r.9-25r.10)
Many of the quotations in this section have been quoted verbatim in earlier ones. For example, a woman should not expose her navel, ankles or breasts (Sdhp.</description>

      <description>V. Tryambaka&amp;rsquo;s Conclusion: Obedient Service to one&amp;rsquo;s Husband is the Primary Religious Duty (of a wife)
(patiśuśrusanam mukhyo dharmaḥ; Sdhp.48v. 7-88r. 1).
Tryambaka returns to the point at which he began. &amp;lsquo;Obedient service to one&amp;rsquo;s husband (bhartṛśuśruṣaṇam, Sdhp.1v.2; patiśuśrūsanam, Sdhp.48v.7) is the primary religious duty enjoined by sacred tradition for women&amp;rsquo; (see section I, introductory verse 1, p.29, note 2). In this section, he defines obedient service to one&amp;rsquo;s husband&amp;rsquo; in three ways.</description>
